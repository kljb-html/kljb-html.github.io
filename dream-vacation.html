    <h1>A Dream Vacation - Greece </h1>

    <p>If I were to ever pick somewhere to travel to for a vacation, it would have to be Greece. It has always been beautiful to me, both it's land and countless islands. It's full of rich history that has interested me for a long time, and it would be awesome to see fascinating relics of the past in person. I would love to stay in a beach house near the coast while I travel to see ancient ruins and try out food I've never had before.</p>
